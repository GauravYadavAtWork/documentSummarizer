Smart Document Summarizer
A full-stack web application that allows users to upload documents (PDFs or images), extracts the text content using the Google Gemini API, and then generates intelligent summaries of varying lengths.
📝 Overview
This application provides a seamless workflow for digesting large documents. A user uploads a file through a sleek, responsive interface. The frontend sends this file to a secure Node.js backend, which then communicates with the Google Gemini API to perform powerful text extraction (OCR for images, parsing for PDFs). Once the text is extracted and displayed to the user, they can request a short, medium, or long summary, which is also generated by the Gemini API via the backend.

✨ Key Features
Secure Backend API: All communication with the Google Gemini API is handled by a Node.js backend, keeping API keys safe and secure.

File Upload Interface: A clean, drag-and-drop file upload component for PDFs and common image formats.

AI-Powered Text Extraction: Leverages the Gemini API's multimodal capabilities to accurately extract text from both PDFs and images (OCR).

AI-Powered Summarization: Generates concise and contextually relevant summaries in three different lengths (Short, Medium, Long).

Responsive & Modern UI: The interface is built with React and Tailwind CSS, ensuring a great user experience on any device, from mobile phones to desktops.

Animated & Interactive: Smooth animations and visual feedback provide a polished and engaging user experience.

🚀 Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Node.js and npm: Make sure you have Node.js (version 18 or newer recommended) and npm installed. You can download them from nodejs.org.

Google Gemini API Key: You need an API key from Google AI Studio.

1. Backend Setup
First, let's get the server running.

# 1. Navigate into the backend directory
cd backend

# 2. Install the required npm packages
npm install

# 3. Create an environment file
# For Windows:
copy .env.example .env
# For macOS/Linux:
cp .env.example .env

4. Add your API Key:
Open the newly created .env file and paste your Google Gemini API key:

GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSy...your...key...here

5. Start the backend server:

node app.js

The server should now be running and listening on http://localhost:3001.

2. Frontend Setup
Now, let's start the React application in a new terminal window.

# 1. Navigate into your frontend project directory
# (This might be the root folder or a 'frontend' folder depending on your setup)
cd ../frontend

# 2. Install the required npm packages
npm install

# 3. Start the React development server
npm run dev

Your React application should now be running and accessible at http://localhost:5173 (or another port specified by Vite/Create React App). You can now open this URL in your browser to use the application.

kullanım
Open the Application: Navigate to the frontend URL in your browser.

Upload a File: Drag and drop a PDF or image file onto the designated area, or click to open the file selector.
View Extracted Text: The application will process the file and display the extracted text content.

Generate a Summary: Click on the "Short," "Medium," or "Long" buttons to generate a summary of the desired length.

↔️ API Endpoints
The backend exposes two main endpoints that the frontend consumes:

POST /api/extract

Accepts a multipart/form-data request with a file attached to the document key.

Returns a JSON object with the extracted text: { "extractedText": "..." }.

POST /api/summarize

Accepts a JSON body with the text and desired length: { "textToSummarize": "...", "length": "short" }.

Returns a JSON object with the summary: { "summary": "..." }.
